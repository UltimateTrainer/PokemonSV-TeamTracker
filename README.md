# PokemonSV-TeamTracker
A tracker for Pokemon teams in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Can be used to display your team for streaming your single player playthrough or Battle Stadium battles.
## Installation
If you already have the NodeCG framework just clone the above code and put it in a folder named "PokemonSV-TeamTracker" and run NodeCG

In releases, it includes the NodeCG framework needed to use the tracker. Run the nodecg.bat file and head to localhost:9090 in a web browser.

## Usage
From localhost:9090 there should be a box labeled "Stream" and several dropdown menus for noting down Pokemon and clicking on the checkboxes next to them 
will highlight the Pokemon for Battle Stadium. The tracker will not auto update when a menu item is changed and will need to update with the update button 
at the bottom of the panel.

To display the tracker on your stream, go to the top bar of localhost:9090 to graphics and click copy url which layout you'd want. On your perfered streaming 
software, add a browser source and paste the url and change the dimensions of the browser source to the one listed on the graphical layout.
